## Designing Flows

1. Specify the project requirements:
    - Device
    - Frequency
    - etc

2. Design the system behavior:
    - how the program runs
    - how the microcontroller interacts with the 'inside' & 'outside' peripherals
    - etc

3. Create Schematic (Proteus)

4. Write Program

5. Build the program
    - make compile          -> compile main.c
    - make hex              -> transform main.elf to main.hex (.text & .data only)
                               if fuse programming is needed, add flag: '-j .fuse'
    - make get-tracing-list -> for debugging in simulavr & avr-gdb (for timing
                               critical situations)
    - make get-signal       -> simulate simulavr with input signal we want to trace

5. For simple simulation & direct interaction with components, use Proteus
    - make sure all the components are available to simulate

6. If design passes all requirements, proceed to upload to microcontroller
