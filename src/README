## Designing Flows

1. Specify the project requirements:
    - Device
    - Frequency
    - etc

2. Design the system behavior:
    - how the program runs
    - how the microcontroller interacts with the 'inside' & 'outside' peripherals
    - etc

3. Create Schematic (Proteus)

4. Write Program

5. Build the program
    - make compile      -> compile main.c
    - make hex          -> transform main.elf to main.hex (.text & .data only)
                           if fuse programming is needed, add flag: '-j .fuse'
    - make trace        -> for debugging in simavr & avr-gdb (for timing
                           critical situations)

5. For simple simulation & direct interaction with components, use Proteus
    - make sure all the components all

6. If design passes all requirements, proceed to upload to microcontroller

7. Bug? go to make trace

8. Repeat
